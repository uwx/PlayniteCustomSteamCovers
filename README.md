# Playnite Custom Steam Covers Extension

Adds support for loading Steam library grid cover art which you've already added in Steam to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

I created this in a few minutes to load my custom Steam grid covers in Playnite.

## Installation

[Download the .zip](https://github.com/uwx/PlayniteCustomSteamCovers/releases), extract to your Playnite folder (such as `%APPDATA%\Playnite`). .pext version coming soon!

You have to restart Playnite after installing the extension.

## Usage

In your Playnite settings, go to Metadata Sources > Custom Steam Covers, and set the path to your Steam userdata folder.

After that, simply use Edit Game Details > Download Metadata to download with the Custom Steam Covers metadata source. You can also
configure it to be used on all metadata downloads by going to Settings > Metadata.
