# Playnite Custom Steam Covers Extension

Adds support for loading Steam library grid cover art which you've already added in Steam to [Playnite](https://playnite.link/).

I created this in a few minutes to load my custom Steam grid covers in Playnite.

## Installation

[Download the .pext](https://github.com/uwx/PlayniteCustomSteamCovers/releases) and open it with Playnite.

You have to restart Playnite after installing the extension.

## Usage

In your Playnite add-ons menu, go to Extensions settings > Metadata Sources > Custom Steam Covers, and set the path to your Steam userdata folder.

After that, simply use Edit Game Details > Download Metadata to download with the Custom Steam Covers metadata source. You can also
configure it to be used on all metadata downloads by going to Settings > Metadata.
